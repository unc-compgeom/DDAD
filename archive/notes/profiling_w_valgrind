This document contains a quick reminder on how I profile.

First, in the top level CMakeLists.txt file, set the run_type to profile:
    # run types are profile, time and debug
    #set(run_type "time")
    set(run_type "profile")
    #set(run_type "debug")

Next, recompile, and run the program to profile, <PROG> though valgrind's
callgrind tool:
    > valgrind --tool=callgrind <PROG>
Valgrind will produce a file called callgrind.out.<PID>

Finally, view valgrind's output with kcachegrind:
    > kcachegrind callgrind.out.<PID>

PROFILE!
