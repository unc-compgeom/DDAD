The DDAD library is stored in an svn repository.  You can check out the library
code with the command:

    svn co https://cvs.cs.unc.edu/svn/deg_driven_algo_design

Personally, I prefer to interact with an svn repository via git-svn.  If you
want to use git-svn as well use the command:

    git svn clone -s https://cvs.cs.unc.edu/svn/deg_driven_algo_design

Next, you will need to install the dependencies.  Below are the instructions for
Mac OS X and Linux.

Setting up dependancies on OS X:

Assuming you checked out to the directory deg_driven_algo_design, which we will
call $DDAD, change to the dependancy directory:
    
    cd $DDAD/ddad/deps

In this folder you will see tar and gzipped files for cmake, gtest, and rlog.
Strictly speaking the library has no dependancies, (but setting up a build will
be difficult without the dependancies). 

First insall rlog by unzipping rlog

    tar xvzf rlog-1.4-dave_patch.tgz

Read and follow the INSTALL directions.  If you are impatient, most of the time
insallation will go as follows:
    
    cd rlog-1.4-dave_patch
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

Next install gtest by steps parallel to installing rlog.  From the director
$DDAD/ddad/deps the basic steps are: 

    tar xvzf gtest-1.6.0.tgz
    cd gtest-1.6.0
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

Finally install cmake.  On OS X it is easiest to do this directly from Kitware at
http://www.cmake.org/ on Linux it is probably in your package manager, but if
not, the basic steps are:

    tar xvzf cmake-2.8.7.tar.gz 
    cd cmake-2.8.7
    ./configure
    make 
    sudo make insall

Now, you can build the library as follows: 
    
    cd $DDAD/ddad/
    mkdir build
    cd build

To build using make files:

    cmake ..
    make

Of if you are on OS X and like Xcode 

    cmake -G Xcode ..

and open the Xcode project.


Enjoy!
