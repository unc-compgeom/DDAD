The Degree Driven Algorithm Design Library
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Algorithm designers try to minimize use of resources of time and memory space.
Our work considers arithmetic precision as another resource, and minimizes the
degree of polynomials used in the geometric tests or predicates that are
applied. This repository contains all code built as part of the Degree Driven
Geometric Algorithm Design project at UNC Chapel Hill.
