% \subsection{Polyline2r}
% 
% Inside \texttt{qt\_window\_main.cpp}, we create a ``Create Polyline'' button and
% connect its triggered signal to the \texttt{onCreatePolylineTriggered} slot. We
% add this to the toolbar inside of a buttongroup with other buttons that are
% mutually exclusive (e.g. creating a polytope). The
% \texttt{onCreatePolylineTriggered} slot simply sets the input state to
% \texttt{CREATE\_POLYLINE}.
