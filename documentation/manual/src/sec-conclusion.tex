\section{Lessons Learned and Future Directions} 

Implementing a geometric algorithm workbench is a challenging task with a rich
set of problems encompassing a variety of disciplines. We converged on an
interesting events design in which the user annotates observable objects to
signal changes in their visual state. The user specifies visual state on points,
line segments, and triangles, determines delay length between animation
sequences, and directs the viewing camera while the animation runs.
	
Many opportunities for improvement and further exploration exist. First,
implementing existing plans of debugging controls affords an immediate
improvement in the tool's usefulness. Second, allowing the presenter to specify
sounds to accompany interesting events provides another means of conveying
information. Finally, creating better abstractions of common data structures and
investigating integration with existing debuggers reduces system invasiveness
for the implementer.
